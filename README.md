<h2>Capstone Project</h2>

This project was built as my final capstone project at Flatiron Bootcamp. This was a full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails backend and React.js for the front end.
The Purpose of the project was the foundational processes and learning of how to connect the backend and the frontend using API responses. And incorporating full CRUD functionality.
